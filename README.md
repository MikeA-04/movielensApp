# MovieLens Application
This console-based, N-tier design project uses Python3 and SQLite to output, insert, and update database information.\
There will be a loop asking the user to input the command they want to execute. If "x", then the program will end. Else, the commands will run by calling on
functions, which will ask the user for further input. Inside those functions, other functions would be called to run all the queries.
